__About Me:__

I'm Diego Smania, a computer scientist with solid knowledges on full stack development. You may check some of the projects in which I made most of my contributions:

- [jeroennoten/Laravel-AdminLTE](https://github.com/jeroennoten/Laravel-AdminLTE) - An [AdminLTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE) integration for the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework.
- [ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE) - A free admin dashboard template based on **Bootstrap 4**.

__Donations:__

I live in Argentina, a country with a high economic inflation where it is really hard to progress. However, I make a great effort to use my free time for contribute to some open source projects. If you feel comfortable with my contributions, please consider becoming a sponsor or make a donation. That way, you will keep me focused and motivated with more contributions. Also, you will be helping to keep my family fed and to upgrade my workstation, among other things.
